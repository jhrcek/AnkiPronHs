# Anki pronunciation downloader

This tool queries my Anki deck for words that don't have associated pronunciation,
searches the words in dictionary, downloads the associated pronunciation mp3 files
and adds reference to the file to anki database.

# TODO
- database backup and copy from HS instead of bash script
- copy downloaded mp3s to Anki collections.media
- copy modified anki db to anki folder
